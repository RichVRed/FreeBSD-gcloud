Google Cloud FreeBSD Image Builder
==================================

Here's my script to create Google Cloud images for FreeBSD. Tweak settings to
taste, it will build an image then give you the commands to run to upload it to
GCE and create an image. Install google-cloud-sdk (net/google-cloud-sdk)
pkg/port to upload and create image.
